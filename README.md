# LocAlarm

My first Android project, LocAlarm is an alarm that goes off when you enter an area that you specify. 

The inspiration for this project came from the many bus rides I needed to take between NYC and my home in NJ. I could never fall asleep on the bus because I was always afraid that I'd sleep too deeply and miss my stop. The idea seemed simple enough, and even if it never took off, at least it'd be something I'd use. 

Currently still in development.
